On the opening night of “West Side Story,” protesters rallied outside a Broadway theater to show support for Alexandra Waterbury, GS ’21, who accused one of the show’s lead actors of sexual harassment.

Jay-Z discussed racial injustice at an event for the new department of African American and African diaspora studies. Student artists then grappled with racism, colonization, and exclusion in their own works. The Black Theatre Ensemble created space for Black stories in a predominantly white theater scene. The Barnard theater department’s well-meaning production of “Men on Boats” couldn’t overcome a script steeped in disturbing historical context.

Despite the setbacks, however, the 2015 hire of head coach Al Bagnoli appears to be paying off, as the team’s 6-4 finish marked the first time in 56 years that it had a winning record two seasons in a row.",
                    "The injuries began piling up during the first game of the season against Central Connecticut State. Star junior wideout Josh Wainwright, who was elected captain for the upcoming season, suffered a torn ACL, which sidelined him for the duration of the season. After a 2017 season in which he broke Columbia’s record for most receiving yards in an individual season, hauling in 1,001 yards, Wainwright gained only 46 yards this season.",
                    "Aside from Wainwright’s devastating injury, the team’s greatest pitfall this year was the lack of an established quarterback or consistent play from any of the four players who took snaps under center. With the graduation of Anders Hill, CC ’18, who threw for over 2,400 yards and led multiple late-game comebacks in 2017, the team struggled to maintain its dominance following his departure.",
                    "Early on in the season, the team turned to sophomore Josh Bean, who spent the majority of his playing time in the 2017-2018 season in a run-oriented wildcat-style position. In the first game of the season, Bean took multiple serious hits to the head, leading him to be sidelined with a concussion. To take over the starting role, the team initially looked to first-year Ty Lenhart, but pulled him out after he failed to lead the team downfield in his first two possessions. The coaching staff then turned to sophomore Dillon Davis, which proved equally unsuccessful.",
                    "After early season questions, the team decided to stick with Lenhart as long as Bean was out—which later became a necessity, as Bean only made appearances in four games. Depending on who was playing quarterback, offensive coordinator Mark Fabish called the game very differently, as Bean finished with an average 28.5 pass attempts in the games in which he appeared, as opposed to Lenhart’s 13.9.",
                    "Ultimately, the team finished fourth among the Ancient Eight, going 3-4 in Ivy League play. Despite the tumultuous 2018 season, expectations are high for next year—as 16 starters will return to the team, seven on offense and nine on defense, with a number of key contributors returning from injury. One thing to watch out for in particular is how well the new quarterbacks coach, Ryan Larsen, and the new wide receivers coach, Jerry Taylor, mesh in Bagnoli’s system.",
                    "Next season will be Bagnoli’s fifth year leading the program, meaning that the entire roster is now comprised of players he recruited. The 2019 season will serve as an opportunity to see whether his vision for the program will translate into success; and as long as the quarterback position is settled, and the team is not plagued by injuries again, there is a good chance that the Lions will be able to rise to the level of success they achieved in 2017."

While third-year head coach Jim Engles chose to go with a smaller lineup at the beginning of the season, starting 6-foot-7-inch, 200-pound sophomore Randy Brumant and 6-foot-7-inch, 240-pound first-year Ike Nweke, Tapé was given more time as the season progressed.

With an average height of 75.5 inches, which ranks 329 out of 353 Division I teams, the team tried to counter taller teams by modernizing their style and committing to three-point shooting. While the Light Blue finished the season ranked 95th in three-point field goals per game, they were unable to make up for the void in talent created in particular by Faulds, who is the highest-ranked high school recruit to ever commit to Columbia.",
                    "The team also struggled in close games, finishing 5-9 in games decided by three or fewer points. No game stands out more than the teams February 8 matchup with Harvard, who finished tied for the best record in league play. In a game that featured three overtime periods, sophomore guard Gabe Stefanini led the way in scoring, dropping 26 points while shooting 10-25 from the field. In addition, senior guard Quinton Adlesh, who will play next season as a graduate transfer for University of Southern California, played a Columbia record 52 minutes in the game, contributing 24 points of his own.",
                    "While this season proved to be another disappointing one, there is hope that the team can improve next year, as Stefanini, an All-Ivy second teamer, and Tapé have another offseason to continue to develop."

Star junior wideout Josh Wainwright, who was elected captain for the upcoming season, suffered a torn ACL, which sidelined him for the duration of the season. After a 2017 season in which he broke Columbia’s record for most receiving yards in an individual season, hauling in 1,001 yards, Wainwright gained only 46 yards this season.",
                        "Aside from Wainwright’s devastating injury, the team’s greatest pitfall this year was the lack of an established quarterback or consistent play from any of the four players who took snaps under center. With the graduation of Anders Hill, CC ’18, who threw for over 2,400 yards and led multiple late-game comebacks in 2017, the team struggled to maintain its dominance following his departure.",

In the first game of the season, Bean took multiple serious hits to the head, leading him to be sidelined with a concussion. To take over the starting role, the team initially looked to first-year Ty Lenhart, but pulled him out after he failed to lead the team downfield in his first two possessions. The coaching staff then turned to sophomore Dillon Davis, which proved equally unsuccessful.",

Depending on who was playing quarterback, offensive coordinator Mark Fabish called the game very differently, as Bean finished with an average 28.5 pass attempts in the games in which he appeared, as opposed to Lenhart’s 13.9.",

Despite the tumultuous 2018 season, expectations are high for next year—as 16 starters will return to the team, seven on offense and nine on defense, with a number of key contributors returning from injury. One thing to watch out for in particular is how well the new quarterbacks coach, Ryan Larsen, and the new wide receivers coach, Jerry Taylor, mesh in Bagnoli’s system.",
                        "Next season will be Bagnoli’s fifth year leading the program, meaning that the entire roster is now comprised of players he recruited. The 2019 season will serve as an opportunity to see whether his vision for the program will translate into success; and as long as the quarterback position is settled, and the team is not plagued by injuries again, there is a good chance that the Lions will be able to rise to the level of success they achieved in 2017."

In the first match of the season against Fordham, first-years Talia Tyler and midfielder Mallaika Tomar both scored the first goals of their college careers. Tyler’s goal was so instrumental in the game that she was awarded Ivy League Rookie of the Week. After shutting out Fordham 3-0, the Lions were unable to replicate their success with three consecutive losses against Rider, Hofstra, and Georgetown. ",
                        "However, in the Light Blue’s Ivy opener against Cornell, the team managed to come back from a 1-0 deficit against the Big Red’s when senior forward Emma Anderson scored the equalizer in the 87th minute and junior midfielder Maddie Temares tucked away the game-winning shot in double overtime. The Lions’ wins at Cornell and Brown led to the team reaching the number one spot of the Ivy League table. ",

Hemmings secured the win with a shot in the 58th minute of the game. However, the team was unable to replicate its success, falling to Harvard 2-1 in its season closer. The loss at Harvard led women’s soccer to lock down a fifth-place finish in the Ivy League, ending the season with a record of 8-7-1, 4-3 Ivy. ",
                        "Despite its lackluster results in Ivy play, the Light Blue brought several honors back to Morningside Heights. Junior defender Amalya Johnson won her third consecutive First Team All-Ivy honors and was selected for the NCAA Division I Women's All-East Region third team. This award marks the ninth time in program history that a member of Columbia women’s soccer was named to All-Region honors. Anderson and Johnson were both selected for the NCAA Division I Women’s Scholar All-East Region Team, a first for the program since 2013. ",
                        "After such mixed results in the 2018 season, it’s hard to say what direction the Lions are moving in. However, looking at players like Amalya Johnson, it’s clear that the team is in good hands. "

The Spectator Graphics team has contributed to innovative storytelling across News, Opinion, A&E, Sports, and The Eye in order to showcase the diverse talents of its staff and produce more compelling stories by showing, rather than just telling. A small group — but one with profound impact — the Spectator Graphics team is responsible for building web scrapers, data wrangling, visualizing data, and building interactive stories which seamlessly combine words, data, and visuals that ultimately create stories larger than the sum of their parts. Our team hopes to continue elevating the standard for journalism in the digital age for years to come.",

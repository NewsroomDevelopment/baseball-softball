Many of these limitations were transcended this year like never before, starting with the work of renowned filmmaker and choreographer Yvonne Rainer, this year’s Lida A. Orzeck ’68 Distinguished Artist-in-Residence, who played a key role in the development of postmodern dance. At the Athena Film Festival, Virtual Reality Sessions let festival-goers experience film through VR, joining other fast-growing film industries in shaping the future of cinema. Although Athena only happens once a year, students will now be able to access groundbreaking technology year-round with the opening of Barnard’s Movement Lab, an innovative space for research across several disciplines. In addition, technical spectacles in theater improved dramatically. Colony Collapse, a production by the Barnard Theatre Department, featured a twenty-foot honeycomb made of recycled steel, scrap plywood and used cardboard from Barnard Dining Services. Combined with complex lighting rigs and sound effects, tech took center stage in this production. And while technology can help us push boundaries in the arts, so can visionary leaders. Zehra Naqvi, CC ’21, and her sister Sophia, CC ’23, are redefining what it means to be fashion entrepreneurs, having launched their line of empowering t-shirts at the age of 15 and 13, respectively.

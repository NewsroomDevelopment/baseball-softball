The fall semester began with another shocking lawsuit against the former dean of students in the School of General Studies, who was removed from his post soon after University administrators became aware of his misconduct, Columbia said in a statement. Around that time, a business school student publicly spoke out about allegations against a classmate, and claimed that she was not given proper accommodations and forced to see him unless she adjusted her own daily schedule. Behind the scenes, Columbia’s handling of allegations, particularly those against tenured faculty, proved to be unimaginably complex—many of those accused or found guilty remain on campus, facing few sanctions, and even continuing to teach students.",

In lieu of Columbia’s unwillingness to budge, the union announced that it would strike again in December 2018—a postdoctoral union had also formed and been verified at this time—to increase pressure on the University. Finally, days before the strike was authorized to begin, University President Lee Bollinger announced that Columbia would bargain with both unions, under the condition that they sign a bargaining framework including a no-strike provision until April 2020. The bargaining framework has since proven a significant point of contention for the graduate student union.",

With the release of a whopping 145-page report on the status of female and underrepresented minority faculty members within Arts and Sciences, the Policy Planning Committee continued to spark conversation across the University regarding racism, harassment, and discrimination in academia. Though Columbia as a university has dedicated $185 million in funds to hiring diverse faculty, the report showed that departments will require substantial cultural and policy-level change in order to rectify disparities caused by lack of resources for faculty childcare and nonexistent grievance procedures to report instances of harassment, among other issues. As Provost John Coatsworth is set to step down at the end of June, questions regarding resources for faculty, pipeline programs for diversity, and faculty benefits will be transferred to a new administrator for the first time in nearly a decade.",

Many of these limitations were transcended this year like never before, starting with the work of renowned filmmaker and choreographer Yvonne Rainer, this year’s Lida A. Orzeck ’68 Distinguished Artist-in-Residence, who played a key role in the development of postmodern dance. At the Athena Film Festival, Virtual Reality Sessions let festival-goers experience film through VR, joining other fast-growing film industries in shaping the future of cinema. Although Athena only happens once a year, students will now be able to access groundbreaking technology year-round with the opening of Barnard’s Movement Lab, an innovative space for research across several disciplines. In addition, technical spectacles in theater improved dramatically. Colony Collapse, a production by the Barnard Theatre Department, featured a twenty-foot honeycomb made of recycled steel, scrap plywood and used cardboard from Barnard Dining Services. Combined with complex lighting rigs and sound effects, tech took center stage in this production. And while technology can help us push boundaries in the arts, so can visionary leaders. Zehra Naqvi, CC ’21, and her sister Sophia, CC ’23, are redefining what it means to be fashion entrepreneurs, having launched their line of empowering t-shirts at the age of 15 and 13, respectively.

Despite the setbacks, however, the 2015 hire of head coach Al Bagnoli appears to be paying off, as the team’s 6-4 finish marked the first time in 56 years that it had a winning record two seasons in a row.",
                    "The injuries began piling up during the first game of the season against Central Connecticut State. Star junior wideout Josh Wainwright, who was elected captain for the upcoming season, suffered a torn ACL, which sidelined him for the duration of the season. After a 2017 season in which he broke Columbia’s record for most receiving yards in an individual season, hauling in 1,001 yards, Wainwright gained only 46 yards this season.",
                    "Aside from Wainwright’s devastating injury, the team’s greatest pitfall this year was the lack of an established quarterback or consistent play from any of the four players who took snaps under center. With the graduation of Anders Hill, CC ’18, who threw for over 2,400 yards and led multiple late-game comebacks in 2017, the team struggled to maintain its dominance following his departure.",
                    "Early on in the season, the team turned to sophomore Josh Bean, who spent the majority of his playing time in the 2017-2018 season in a run-oriented wildcat-style position. In the first game of the season, Bean took multiple serious hits to the head, leading him to be sidelined with a concussion. To take over the starting role, the team initially looked to first-year Ty Lenhart, but pulled him out after he failed to lead the team downfield in his first two possessions. The coaching staff then turned to first-year Dillon Davis, which proved equally unsuccessful.",
                    "After early season questions, the team decided to stick with Lenhart as long as Bean was out—which later became a necessity, as Bean only made appearances in four games. Depending on who was playing quarterback, offensive coordinator Mark Fabish called the game very differently, as Bean finished with an average 28.5 pass attempts in the games in which he appeared, as opposed to Lenhart’s 13.9.",
                    "Ultimately, the team finished fourth among the Ancient Eight, going 3-4 in Ivy League play. Despite the tumultuous 2018 season, expectations are high for next year—as 16 starters will return to the team, seven on offense and nine on defense, with a number of key contributors returning from injury. One thing to watch out for in particular is how well the new quarterbacks coach, Ryan Larsen, and the new wide receivers coach, Jerry Taylor, mesh in Bagnoli’s system.",
                    "Next season will be Bagnoli’s fifth year leading the program, meaning that the entire roster is now comprised of players he recruited. The 2019 season will serve as an opportunity to see whether his vision for the program will translate into success; and as long as the quarterback position is settled, and the team is not plagued by injuries again, there is a good chance that the Lions will be able to rise to the level of success they achieved in 2017."

                    "The departures, particularly those of forwards Jaron Faulds and Lukas Meisner, left the team with only one traditional big man on the roster, 6-foot-10-inch junior forward Patrick Tapé. While third-year head coach Jim Engles chose to go with a smaller lineup at the beginning of the season, starting 6-foot-7-inch, 200-pound sophomore Randy Brumant and 6-foot-7-inch, 240-pound first-year Ike Nweke, Tapé was given more time as the season progressed. It became clear early on that the lack of an interior presence allowed Columbia’s opponents to score inside seemingly at will. Engles’ adjustment paid off, as Tapé was selected as an honorable mention for the All-Ivy team.",

With an average height of 75.5 inches, which ranks 329 out of 353 Division I teams, the team tried to counter taller teams by modernizing their style and committing to three-point shooting. While the Light Blue finished the season ranked 95th in three-point field goals per game, they were unable to make up for the void in talent created in particular by Faulds, who is the highest-ranked high school recruit to ever commit to Columbia.",
                    "The team also struggled in close games, finishing 5-9 in games decided by three or fewer points. No game stands out more than the teams February 8 matchup with Harvard, who finished tied for the best record in league play. In a game that featured two overtime periods, sophomore guard Gabe Stefanini led the way in scoring, dropping 26 points while shooting 10-25 from the field. In addition, senior guard Quinton Adlesh, who will play next season as a graduate transfer for University of Southern California, played a Columbia record 52 minutes in the game, contributing 24 points of his own.",
                    "While this season proved to be another disappointing one, there is hope that the team can improve next year, as Stefanini, an All-Ivy second teamer, and Tapé have another offseason to continue to develop."

                    "The Lions came into this season with high hopes. Despite the loss of midfielder Haris Stamboulidis—who signed with Aris Thessaloniki F.C. of the Super League Greece and decided to sit his senior season out—the team did not lack fresh talent; former assistant coach Ken Pollard was promoted to associate head coach, Jefferson Baum, CC ’08, came on as assistant coach, and seven first-years joined the ranks.",
                    "Expectations for the team were high going into the fall season, especially given the talented roster. Junior Vana Markarian was ranked No. 81 out of all returning players by TopDrawerSoccer and No. 3 out of returning players in the Ivy League. Moreover, junior midfielder John Denis was ranked No. 6 in the Ivy League, sophomore defender Blake Willis was ranked No. 11, and junior midfielder Danny Laranetto No. 14. ",
                    "In their season-opening weekend, the Lions defeated No. 11-ranked Butler 2-1. Junior John Denis was named Ivy League Player of the Week after scoring a goal against Butler and notching an assist in a game against West Point. Facing off against Binghamton, senior captain Kynan Rocks scored a hat trick, leading the team to a shutout of the Bearcats. ",
                    "As Ivy play began, senior goalkeeper Dylan Castanheira blocked six attempts on goal to secure Columbia’s 3-1 win against Brown. The Light Blue went on to beat Penn 2-0 in its second match of conference play with goals from senior Dylan Mott and senior defender Nick Azuma. However, the team’s early success was soon followed by an emotional 2-0 loss to Princeton. ",
                    "The Lions were clearly unfazed, as they defeated Yale, Dartmouth, and Harvard shortly thereafter. Mott’s dominance on the field was undeniable in the game against Harvard, where he scored a brace. ",
                    "In the final match of the season, the team fell in overtime to Cornell, cementing its second-place finish in the Ivy League. Though Denis opened the scoring with a goal in the 59th minute, the Big Red managed to pull one back in regulation, putting the game away with a goal just six minutes into extra time. ",
                    "Castanheira was eventually signed by Atlanta United and was awarded All-Ivy League academic honors alongside Markarian. ",
                    "Finishing the season as Ivy runner-up and with a 10-5-1 record, the team will look to next fall to see whether or not it can seize the crown from Cornell without Castanheira and Mott."

In the first match of the season against Fordham, first-years Talia Tyler and midfielder Mallaika Tomar both scored the first goals of their college careers. Tyler’s goal was so instrumental in the game that she was awarded Ivy League Rookie of the Week. After shutting out Fordham 3-0, the Lions were unable to replicate their success with three consecutive losses against Rider, Hofstra, and Georgetown. ",
                    "However, in the Light Blue’s Ivy opener against Cornell, the team managed to come back from a 1-0 deficit against the Big Red’s when senior forward Emma Anderson scored the equalizer in the 87th minute and junior midfielder Maddie Temares tucked away the game-winning shot in double overtime. The Lions’ wins at Cornell and Brown led to the team reaching the number one spot of the Ivy League table. ",
                    "The team’s top of the table status was short-lived, however, as it fell to Penn 1-0, followed by another 1-0 loss to Princeton.",
                    "A two-game losing streak did not stifle the spirit of the team, however, as it went on to defeat Dartmouth 1-0. First-year midfielder Jessica Schildkraut, who was later awarded Ivy League Rookie of the Year, found the net with the sole goal of the game in the 37th minute.",
                    "For the first time since 2015, the Light Blue defeated Yale 2-0. Schildkraut made the first goal of the day with an assist from Anderson. Hemmings secured the win with a shot in the 58th minute of the game. However, the team was unable to replicate its success, falling to Harvard 2-1 in its season closer. The loss at Harvard led women’s soccer to lock down a fifth-place finish in the Ivy League, ending the season with a record of 8-7-1, 4-3 Ivy. ",
                    "Despite its lackluster results in Ivy play, the Light Blue brought several honors back to Morningside Heights. Junior defender Amalya Johnson won her third consecutive First Team All-Ivy honors and was selected for the NCAA Division I Women's All-East Region third team. This award marks the ninth time in program history that a member of Columbia women’s soccer was named to All-Region honors. Anderson and Johnson were both selected for the NCAA Division I Women’s Scholar All-East Region Team, a first for the program since 2013. ",
                    "After such mixed results in the 2018 season, it’s hard to say what direction the Lions are moving in. However, looking at players like Amalya Johnson, it’s clear that the team is in good hands. "

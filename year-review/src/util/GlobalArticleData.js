        "blurb": "In the past year, Spectator’s photo section has weathered many challenges. Taking photos of a campus that was missing the majority of its student population presented numerous difficulties, and our work was complicated by only having a handful of photographers in New York City. Despite these challenges, we pioneered new methods of capturing photos, participating in everything from socially distanced portrait sessions to Zoom and FaceTime photoshoots. We completed photo essays, captured events everywhere from Times Square to West Harlem, took portraits of campus leaders and students, and worked to ensure Spectator’s articles received suitable visual coverage. Here, you will find just a glimpse of our work, including our coverage of virtual theater performances, President Joe Biden’s election, and the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers’ strike.",

As the pandemic exacerbated long-standing systemic inequities, it challenged us to question what “normal” is.

With a tentative agreement rejected in April, resignations from all 10 members of the bargaining committee, and the union’s upcoming elections, it remains to be seen whether Columbia’s student workers will reach a contract with the University.

Spectator took a look at many of the political hopefuls, including Columbia Law School alum Andrew Yang, who launched his campaign less than a mile away from Columbia at Morningside Park.",

While some wrote and produced their own albums, others expanded their fashion brands or choreographed their own dance routines. Mamadou Yattassaye, CC ’21, released his debut album, “To Stitch a Rose,” which revolves around themes of faith and vulnerability. Chase Guerin, CC ’23, worked to redefine the luxury goods industry by bringing symbolism and storytelling into his luxury lifestyle brand, Guerin. And Sarah Kinsley, CC ’22, recently reached almost one million Spotify streams for her single “Karma.”",

The Wallach Art Gallery, for example, held its Uptown Triennial featuring artists of color in dialogue with the Harlem Renaissance, while the 2021 MODA Curates exhibition examined the intersection of aesthetics and cultural history. The Core Curriculum recently underwent some changes, such as the introduction of Claudia Rankine’s “Citizen” into the Literature Humanities curriculum and music of the civil rights era into the Music Humanities curriculum. Student groups like Black Theatre Ensemble showcased works that empowered artists of color while questioning how the theater industry currently functions. With some students lacking resources or materials to complete their required classes from home, some departments helped students financially or mailed over supplies. In addition, after an upsurge in anti-Asian violence, some arts groups raised money for community organizations to support vulnerable populations.",

About 90 percent of neighborhood restaurants remained open, and a number of newcomers have occupied empty storefronts. But restaurants were hit particularly hard, especially those which relied more on in-person dining than takeout and delivery. Restaurants struggling to adapt to the freezing winter with little to no indoor seating lead to many coming up with creative ways to deliver food, cater to the local population, and give back to the community. On the academic side, COVID-19 inspired the creation of new courses that pushed students to think themselves out of the pandemic. Many courses had to be completely rethought for a virtual setting, such as theater classes that rely heavily on in-person interaction. Despite some obstacles, many student artists were able to keep up with their crafts at home, looking toward social media as a way to market their creations.",

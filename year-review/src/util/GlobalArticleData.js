        "blurb": "In the past year, Spectator’s photo section has weathered many challenges. Taking photos of a campus that was missing the majority of its student population presented numerous difficulties, and our work was complicated by only having a handful of photographers in New York City. Despite these challenges, we pioneered new methods of capturing photos, participating in everything from socially distanced portrait sessions to Zoom and FaceTime photoshoots. We completed photo essays, captured events everywhere from Times Square to West Harlem, took portraits of campus leaders and students, and worked to ensure Spectator’s articles received suitable visual coverage. Here, you will find just a glimpse of our work, including our coverage of virtual theater performances, President Joe Biden’s election, and the Graduate Workers of Columbia-United Auto Workers’ strike.",

Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, whose play “Father Comes Home From the Wars” was added to the Literature Humanities syllabus on the 100th anniversary of the Core Curriculum, spoke about exploring the contemporary Black experience through literature. Jay-Z discussed racial injustice at an event for the new department of African American and African diaspora studies. Student artists then grappled with racism, colonization, and exclusion in their own works. The Black Theatre Ensemble created space for Black stories in a predominantly white theater scene. The Barnard theater department’s well-meaning production of “Men on Boats” couldn’t overcome a script steeped in disturbing historical context. And the Chinese Students Club slashed stereotypes at its annual Lunar Gala fashion show in the face of discrimination against Asian students in the wake of COVID-19.",

Just weeks later, after the pandemic touched Columbia, the University community was upended and moved to Zoom.",

A small group — but one with profound impact — the Spectator Graphics team is responsible for building web scrapers, data wrangling, visualizing data, and building interactive stories which seamlessly combine words, data, and visuals that ultimately create stories larger than the sum of their parts.

They photographed administrators and community meetings, student protests and CCSC meetings, football games and the odd politician—all in search of the split seconds that make up our campus. As we look back on a year’s worth of photos, we emerge with a picture of what our campus looks like: at times divided, at times united, but always ours. ",

In lieu of Columbia’s unwillingness to budge, the union announced that it would strike again in December 2018—a postdoctoral union had also formed and been verified at this time—to increase pressure on the University. Finally, days before the strike was authorized to begin, University President Lee Bollinger announced that Columbia would bargain with both unions, under the condition that they sign a bargaining framework including a no-strike provision until April 2020. The bargaining framework has since proven a significant point of contention for the graduate student union.",

This year, of course, Bacchanal was actually canceled in light of the COVID-19 outbreak. The concert would have taken place off campus at Terminal 5, a decision which sparked debate about the role of Bacchanal in cultivating community on campus. While we didn’t get to see whether the move would have been a success, student musicians rallied on Instagram Live to create a digital substitute for the spring tradition.",

Women who spoke out against Harvey Weinstein and Russell Simmons discussed the trajectory of the #MeToo movement in the film and music industries. On the opening night of “West Side Story,” protesters rallied outside a Broadway theater to show support for Alexandra Waterbury, GS ’21, who accused one of the show’s lead actors of sexual harassment.

I remember having breakfast with a friend during the lowest point of my first spiral and telling him how I was feeling. He told me ardently, urgently, that things do get better, no matter how empty I was feeling at the time. And I remember looking at him dead in the eyes and not believing a word that he said. I remember thinking that things could never get better, that he couldn’t understand. But here I am now. He was right.”",

Despite the setbacks, however, the 2015 hire of head coach Al Bagnoli appears to be paying off, as the team’s 6-4 finish marked the first time in 56 years that it had a winning record two seasons in a row.",
                    "The injuries began piling up during the first game of the season against Central Connecticut State. Star junior wideout Josh Wainwright, who was elected captain for the upcoming season, suffered a torn ACL, which sidelined him for the duration of the season. After a 2017 season in which he broke Columbia’s record for most receiving yards in an individual season, hauling in 1,001 yards, Wainwright gained only 46 yards this season.",
                    "Aside from Wainwright’s devastating injury, the team’s greatest pitfall this year was the lack of an established quarterback or consistent play from any of the four players who took snaps under center. With the graduation of Anders Hill, CC ’18, who threw for over 2,400 yards and led multiple late-game comebacks in 2017, the team struggled to maintain its dominance following his departure.",
                    "Early on in the season, the team turned to sophomore Josh Bean, who spent the majority of his playing time in the 2017-2018 season in a run-oriented wildcat-style position. In the first game of the season, Bean took multiple serious hits to the head, leading him to be sidelined with a concussion. To take over the starting role, the team initially looked to first-year Ty Lenhart, but pulled him out after he failed to lead the team downfield in his first two possessions. The coaching staff then turned to sophomore Dillon Davis, which proved equally unsuccessful.",
                    "After early season questions, the team decided to stick with Lenhart as long as Bean was out—which later became a necessity, as Bean only made appearances in four games. Depending on who was playing quarterback, offensive coordinator Mark Fabish called the game very differently, as Bean finished with an average 28.5 pass attempts in the games in which he appeared, as opposed to Lenhart’s 13.9.",
                    "Ultimately, the team finished fourth among the Ancient Eight, going 3-4 in Ivy League play. Despite the tumultuous 2018 season, expectations are high for next year—as 16 starters will return to the team, seven on offense and nine on defense, with a number of key contributors returning from injury. One thing to watch out for in particular is how well the new quarterbacks coach, Ryan Larsen, and the new wide receivers coach, Jerry Taylor, mesh in Bagnoli’s system.",
                    "Next season will be Bagnoli’s fifth year leading the program, meaning that the entire roster is now comprised of players he recruited. The 2019 season will serve as an opportunity to see whether his vision for the program will translate into success; and as long as the quarterback position is settled, and the team is not plagued by injuries again, there is a good chance that the Lions will be able to rise to the level of success they achieved in 2017."

                    "The departures, particularly those of forwards Jaron Faulds and Lukas Meisner, left the team with only one traditional big man on the roster, 6-foot-10-inch junior forward Patrick Tapé. While third-year head coach Jim Engles chose to go with a smaller lineup at the beginning of the season, starting 6-foot-7-inch, 200-pound sophomore Randy Brumant and 6-foot-7-inch, 240-pound first-year Ike Nweke, Tapé was given more time as the season progressed. It became clear early on that the lack of an interior presence allowed Columbia’s opponents to score inside seemingly at will. Engles’ adjustment paid off, as Tapé was selected as an honorable mention for the All-Ivy team.",

With an average height of 75.5 inches, which ranks 329 out of 353 Division I teams, the team tried to counter taller teams by modernizing their style and committing to three-point shooting. While the Light Blue finished the season ranked 95th in three-point field goals per game, they were unable to make up for the void in talent created in particular by Faulds, who is the highest-ranked high school recruit to ever commit to Columbia.",
                    "The team also struggled in close games, finishing 5-9 in games decided by three or fewer points. No game stands out more than the teams February 8 matchup with Harvard, who finished tied for the best record in league play. In a game that featured three overtime periods, sophomore guard Gabe Stefanini led the way in scoring, dropping 26 points while shooting 10-25 from the field. In addition, senior guard Quinton Adlesh, who will play next season as a graduate transfer for University of Southern California, played a Columbia record 52 minutes in the game, contributing 24 points of his own.",
                    "While this season proved to be another disappointing one, there is hope that the team can improve next year, as Stefanini, an All-Ivy second teamer, and Tapé have another offseason to continue to develop."

The University holds the power to shape the resources of its surrounding communities, and as an Ivy League institution and multi-billion-dollar corporation, its policies set precedents for institutions across the nation. Amid the struggle for healthcare access and financial security, Columbia wielded great influence over how students, faculty, and the West Harlem community has grappled with the effects of a public health crisis.",

Classes were moved online and students frantically left the city—the same city that would soon become the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States. And while the news came as a shock to many, public health experts say the University, along with other universities across the country, responded too slowly to the pandemic due to national mixed messaging and lack of accountability. Spectator’s graphics team compiled announcements from Ivy League and international universities. Its findings: U.S. schools failed to respond to the outbreak in a timely manner, responding slower than the international schools that faced outbreaks sooner.",

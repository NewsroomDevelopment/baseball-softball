                "blurb": "The summer saw Columbia face a high-profile lawsuit involving a former business school faculty member and a senior professor in her department, resulting in a million-dollar settlement. The fall semester began with another shocking lawsuit against the former dean of students in the School of General Studies, who was removed from his post soon after University administrators became aware of his misconduct, Columbia said in a statement. Around that time, a business school student publicly spoke out about allegations against a classmate, and claimed that she was not given proper accommodations and forced to see him unless she adjusted her own daily schedule. Behind the scenes, Columbia’s handling of allegations, particularly those against tenured faculty, proved to be unimaginably complex—many of those accused or found guilty remain on campus, facing few sanctions, and even continuing to teach students.",

In lieu of Columbia’s unwillingness to budge, the union announced that it would strike again in December 2018—a postdoctoral union had also formed and been verified at this time—to increase pressure on the University. Finally, days before the strike was authorized to begin, University President Lee Bollinger announced that Columbia would bargain with both unions, under the condition that they sign a bargaining framework including a no-strike provision until April 2020. The bargaining framework has since proven a significant point of contention for the graduate student union.",

With the release of a whopping 145-page report on the status of female and underrepresented minority faculty members within Arts and Sciences, the Policy Planning Committee continued to spark conversation across the University regarding racism, harassment, and discrimination in academia. Though Columbia as a university has dedicated $185 million in funds to hiring diverse faculty, the report showed that departments will require substantial cultural and policy-level change in order to rectify disparities caused by lack of resources for faculty childcare and nonexistent grievance procedures to report instances of harassment, among other issues. As Provost John Coatsworth is set to step down at the end of June, questions regarding resources for faculty, pipeline programs for diversity, and faculty benefits will be transferred to a new administrator for the first time in nearly a decade.",
